## Professional Developer Codes

1. Using most of provided features of framework. e.g. - `@Autowired` annotation.

2. Proper naming convention of file and well packaging.
    e.g. -  `com.code.entity`, `com.code.controller` etc.

3. Used **lombok** to ignore unnecessary `getter` and `setter`.
    It is recommended by **Spring Boot**.
    
4. Used **interfaces**.

5. No unnecessary comment. But used jav doc annotations.
    e.g /** method description**/
    
6. Used `@ControllerAdvice` to handle all exception in entire application. No need to extra try and catch block i all business classes.
